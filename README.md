## Introduction

In the real estate industry, predicting house prices is crucial for buyers, sellers, and investors. This project leverages various data analytics algorithms to create a model that predicts house prices based on features such as location, size, number of rooms, and other relevant factors. 

## Project Overview

The project is divided into the following stages:

1. **Data Collection:** Gathered real estate data from various sources.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and transformed the data for analysis.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Extracted and selected relevant features to improve model performance.
4. **Model Selection:** Tested multiple machine learning models to find the best fit for the data.
5. **Evaluation:** Evaluated the selected model using appropriate metrics.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for exploring the dataset and model training)
